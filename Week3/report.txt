Not really going to bother with filesystems, macbook air seems to just have one hfs device so I'll use that. Week4 and 5 used ukko when applicable.
pipe download to extraction

the proxyconfig just isn't going to go anywhere
Mayses-MacBook-Air:Week3 miikas$ ssh -F proxyConfig ukko124 "ls"
ssh: Could not resolve hostname ukko124: nodename nor servname provided, or not known
Mayses-MacBook-Air:Week3 miikas$ vim proxyConfig 
Mayses-MacBook-Air:Week3 miikas$ ssh -F proxyConfig ukko032 "ls"
miikasay@melkki.cs.helsinki.fi's password:

Mayses-MacBook-Air:Week3 miikas$ ssh -F proxyConfig ukko032 "ls"

find ../lost24/monitor/2011.11.24/ -name "hp-temps.txt" -exec cat {} + | grep "PROCESSOR_ZONE" | cut -c 32-34 | uniq | sort
output is in 2011.11.24.temps
making csv like files:
find ../lost24/monitor/2011.11.24/ -name "hp-temps.txt" -exec cat {} + | grep "PROCESSOR_ZONE" | sed -n 's/  */;/gp' | sed -f csv-transform-rules.sed
output is in temps.csv

Mayses-MacBook-Air:monitor miikas$ ls */*/hp-temps.txt
-bash: /bin/ls: Argument list too long

find ../lost24/monitor/2011.11.* -name "hp-temps.txt"
output is in found.txt

find ../lost24/monitor/* -name '*txt'
results in proper output

find ../lost24/monitor/* -name *txt
craps out the expansion to try and give stuff from current directory to find (contains the two .txt files)
find: footest.txt: unknown primary or operator

result in hipstafy.sh

hottest-day.sh (oh my god it's so slow!)
