Figure out how to redirect stdout to one file and stderr to another file simultaneously. Use ls. Present the command:
ls existing/ nonexistant/ > good.txt 2> bad.txt

Try the same thing with cat. What do you think cat is doing to your stdin:
cat    Copy standard input to standard output.

Pipeline ls to grep 'e' to wc in order to count the number of matching files. Present your solution and its output:
ls ~ | grep 'e' | wc -l

Create a bash script count-homedir.sh which counts the number of files in your home directory. Verify that it works. Attach the script contents to your report:
#!/bin/bash
ls -a --format=single-column ~ | grep --colour '^\.' | wc -l
